Default Rules Preprocessor
==========================

This directory contains the implementation of a preprocessor
for Curry programs in order to implement default rules.
A default rule for a function `f` processed by this preprocessor
must be defined as a rule defining the operation `f'default`.

The preprocessor can be called by the Curry preprocessor `currypp`
with the option `defaultrules` (provided as a CYMAKE option,
see the example programs in the directory Examples).
