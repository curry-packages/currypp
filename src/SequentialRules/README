Sequential Rules Preprocessor
=============================

This directory contains the implementation of a preprocessor
for Curry programs in order to implement a sequential rule
ordering. The preprocessor transforms a Curry program
such that the transformed program implements a sequential
rule ordering.

The ideas of this transformation are described in the
[WFLP 2014 paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1335/wflp2014_paper5.pdf).

The preprocessor can be called by the Curry preprocessor `currypp`
with the option `seqrules` (provided as a CYMAKE option,
see the example programs in the directory Examples).
