import HTML

{-
Remark:

The integrated code ``html ...'' expands to a list of HTML expressions,
i.e., to an expression of type [HtmlExp].

A Curry expression enclosed with {...} inside the integrated code
must be of type String and is inserted as (HTML-quoted) text.

A Curry expression enclosed with {{...}} inside the integrated code
must be of type HtmlExp and is inserted as an HTML element.
